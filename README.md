## My process

### Built with

- Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- NextJS
- Responsive Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project introcuded the idea of customizing the bullets of ordered and unordered lists.

### Continued development

My process is coming along well. I will start to templatize more of the initial setup. Too much time is currently spent getting the project started. I would also like to move into working more with Figma and connecting that tool to my development process.
